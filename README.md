Hi, My name is Akash Kumbar. I am a robotics/vision researcher, currently pursuing master's at IIIT-Hyderabad under guidance of Prof. K Madhava Krishna. My experience spans significant contributions to 3D vision, embedded systems, and simulation development for autonomous vehicles, showcasing a proficiency in Python, C++, MATLAB, and hands-on experience with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Nvidia Jetson platforms.
